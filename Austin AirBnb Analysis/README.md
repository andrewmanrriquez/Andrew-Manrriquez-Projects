# Data on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic by Our World in Data

For more general information on our COVID-19 data, see our main README file in [`/public/data`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

## Data sources

The reported all-cause mortality data is from the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/) (HMD) Short-term Mortality Fluctuations project and the [World Mortality Dataset](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality) (WMD). Both sources are updated weekly. We also present estimates of excess deaths globally that are [published by _The Economist_](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model).
